  I lied to you. No company wants to see my SQL skills — I just wanted an excuse so you’d click this link.

    I just wanted you to know I’m really grateful for you and wanted to surprise you with something new.
    This isn't the 3DS game port I had hoped, but I hope this still reminds you how much I love you.
    You make me feel safe, seen, and loved in a way I have never been before. I’m proud of us for making
    it this far and can’t wait for our promising future. I love you so so soooo much!!!

          If you’re reading this, it means I’m thinking about you (which is… always).
          I love the way you exist. I love our little jokes. I love how you feel like home,
          even from far away. I’m not going anywhere. You’re my favorite person.
