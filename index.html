        I lied to you. No company wants to see my SQL skills, I just wanted an excuse so you can check this link. I just wanted you to know I’m really grateful for you but wanted to surprise you in something new. This isn't the 3DS game port I had hoped,
        but I hope this still reminds you how much I love you. You make me feel safe, seen, and loved in a way I have never been before.
        I’m proud of us for making it this far and can't wait for our promising future. I love you so so soooo much!!!

          If you’re reading this, it means I’m thinking about you (which is… always).
          I love the way you exist. I love our little jokes. I love how you feel like home,
          even from far away. I’m not going anywhere. You’re my favorite person.
